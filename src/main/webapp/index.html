            <h2>What is _______?</h2>
            <p> 
                [name] is an online exam platform that allows students and teachers to have more contol
                over how their platform looks. Our aim is to make online testing a more inclussive place 
                for everyone involved. [name] allows users to change their dashboard styling 
                so that it reflects what the user needs as well as all the usual exam platform features. 
                Users have contol over text styling and page colour so that their exam experience is just 
                as managable as in person exams.

                <h3>Accesibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Most testing platforms currently used by colleges put students with disabilities 
                    at a disadvantage. During in person examinations students with disabilities 
                    would be offered accommodations, to ensure that they can compete equally with their peers, 
                    such as scribes, exam papers in alternate formats and readers. These accommodations have not 
                    been implemented in online testing environments, making reading exams and answering the questions 
                    difficult during an already stressful period for these students. We wanted to create a platform
                    that is customisable to a student's specific needs so that they aren't at a disadvantage.

                <h3>Covid-19</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to social distancing restrictions it is difficult for colleges and universities to hold their 
                    exams in person and they are instead turning to online testing platforms. The rush to move from in 
                    person exams to online exams meant that many students and teachers alike were left confused about 
                    online testing and how to use these platforms. As college students we felt like this was a big 
                    aspect of our lives and is something that has been effecting us since March for this reason we wanted
                    to look at the issue and work on a solution.

                <h3>Usability</h3>
                <p>
                    As students we have used exam platforms and know that they don't always have an intuative design.
                    Many exam platforms have too many features that can overwhelm users during an alreadying 
                    overwhelming period. We wanted our platform to to be simple and easy to use so that students and
                    lecturers could quickly and easily do what they need to do.

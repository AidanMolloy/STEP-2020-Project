# Accessible Testing Platform (Google Capstone Project).
We aim to build a testing platform that is accessible to students of all abilities. Due to social distancing restrictions, it is difficult for colleges and universities to hold their exams in person, and they are instead turning to online testing platforms. While these testing platforms are accessible to the average student, they can be challenging to navigate and interact with students with disabilities. This impacts these students' ability to perform in exams and can negatively impact their grades. The goal is to create a customizable platform for students' specific needs so that they aren't at a disadvantage.
